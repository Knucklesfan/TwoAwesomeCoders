# To prove that one exists, they must create a magnum opus

Simply put, this is trash. This sucks.
Very simple SDL2 video player with some goofy ass gaming stuff on top of it as a joke to play family guy clips with madagascar worked into it.

To compile:
install SDL2, SDL2-mixer, and ffmpeg
Ubuntu instructions
```sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev ffmpeg 
```
Arch Linux btw instructions
```
sudo pacman -Syu base-devel sdl2 sdl2_mixer ffmpeg
```

Then, clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Knucklesfan/TwoAwesomeCoders.git
```
Then, actually compile the garbage
```
cd TwoAwesomeCoders
make
```
Place two files in the root directory with the application: `test.mp4` and `test.mp3`.
- test.mp4 is the video
- test.mp3 is the audio of the video

finally, run the garbage

```
./SDLTetris
```

Have fun i guess?????
